Nim
===

A simple iPhone Application featuring configurable games of nim. Play the computer or play a friend.

All code is open source here on github. Please let me know through the github issues of any bugs and/or desired features. I'm still learning the iOS sdk and would greatly appreaciate any input.

Thanks,<br/>
